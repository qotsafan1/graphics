/** A GBuffer is used in deferred rendering. It captures information about eye space 
 position and normal direction for each pixel. Consequently, we can use the GBuffer to 
 capture all the information we need to later shade the scene. 
 Essentially, the GBuffer is a wrapper round a geometry texture (eye space positions)
 a normal texture and a color texture. These textures are rendered to in one go using
 multiple render targets. The GBuffer class sets up an FBO so that you can render to these
 three textures. However, the shader program needed could depend on the object
 being rendered so the program for drawing to a GBuffer is outside the classe. */
